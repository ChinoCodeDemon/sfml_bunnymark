# SFML BunnyMark
## Preamble
This is a small project to test the performance of SFML.
I will of course try this with different frameworks like SDL.
(It could cause epilepsie)

## How to Build
This guide only works on linux i will use arch as example. (macOS might be similar but windows will be way different.)
1. Get sfml on your computer `sudo pacman -S sfml`
2. Make sure you have build tools installed `sudo pacman -S base-devel` (on ubuntu it might be called build-essential)
3. Run `make`
4. Execute `./bunnymark-sfml`
